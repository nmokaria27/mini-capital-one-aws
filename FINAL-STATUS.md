## üìù Implementation Notes

### What Was Implemented Today

1. **getBalance Lambda** (NEW)
   - Created from scratch
   - Retrieves user data from DynamoDB
   - Returns user info, balance, and last updated timestamp

2. **Transaction Service** (FIXED)
   - Updated to work without RDS (cross-region issue)
   - Implements atomic balance updates with race condition prevention
   - Generates unique transaction IDs

3. **Frontend Updates**
   - Implemented balance check functionality
   - Changed balance form from onclick to proper form submission
   - All 3 features now functional

4. **API Gateway Routes**
   - Added `GET /users/{userId}` route
   - Verified all 3 routes working

5. **Deployment Scripts**
   - Created `deploy-getBalance.sh`
   - Created `deploy-transactionService.sh`
   - Created `setup-missing-routes.sh`

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

### RDS Transaction Logging Disabled
**Why**: The existing RDS instance is in `us-east-2`, but all Lambda functions are in `us-east-1`. Cross-region database access causes timeouts.

**Impact**: Transaction history is NOT saved to RDS MySQL. Only the current balance is maintained in DynamoDB.

**Workaround**: Transaction service works perfectly for balance management, just without persistent transaction history.

**To Fix** (Optional):
1. Create new RDS MySQL instance in `us-east-1`
2. Run SQL schema from `database/aurora-schema.sql`
3. Update Lambda to use RDS connection (code already exists in `index-with-secrets.mjs`)

**Cost**: $0 (free tier) for 12 months, then ~$15/month

---

## üí∞ Current Monthly Cost

**Total**: **$0.00** (All within free tier)

- API Gateway: Free (< 1M requests)
- Lambda: Free (< 1M requests)
- DynamoDB: Free (on-demand, low usage)
- Amplify: Free (light usage)
- No RDS charges (not using RDS)

---

- ‚úÖ Real-time balance updates
- ‚úÖ Atomic transactions (no race conditions)
