## Option 1: AWS Console (Manual) 🖱️

**Best for**: Learning, first-time setup, visual learners

### Pros
- ✅ Visual interface - see what you're creating
- ✅ No CLI/code knowledge needed
- ✅ Easy to understand
- ✅ Good for learning AWS services
- ✅ Can explore options easily

### Cons
- ❌ Time-consuming (30+ minutes)
- ❌ Error-prone (easy to miss steps)
- ❌ Not reproducible
- ❌ Hard to share with teammates
- ❌ No version control

### How to Use
Follow: **`DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md`**

**Time**: 30-60 minutes for full setup

**Steps**:
1. Open AWS Console in browser
2. Navigate to each service (DynamoDB, Lambda, API Gateway, etc.)
3. Click through UI to create resources
4. Manually configure each setting

---

## Option 2: AWS CLI Scripts (Automated) 🚀

**Best for**: Quick deployment, automation, reproducibility

### Pros
- ✅ **Fast** - 2-3 minutes for full setup
- ✅ **Reproducible** - same result every time
- ✅ **Scriptable** - can be automated
- ✅ **Version controlled** - track changes in Git
- ✅ **Shareable** - teammates can use same scripts
- ✅ **Idempotent** - safe to re-run

### Cons
- ❌ Requires AWS CLI installed
- ❌ Less visual - harder to see what's created
- ❌ Need to understand bash scripts
- ❌ Debugging is harder

### How to Use
Follow: **`scripts/README.md`**

**Prerequisites**:
```bash
# Install AWS CLI
brew install awscli  # macOS
# or: pip install awscli

# Configure credentials
aws configure
```

**Quick Start**:
```bash
# One command deploys everything!
chmod +x scripts/deploy-all.sh
./scripts/deploy-all.sh
```

**What it does**:
1. ✅ Creates IAM role with all permissions
2. ✅ Creates DynamoDB table
3. ✅ Deploys createUser Lambda
4. ✅ Sets up API Gateway with routes
5. ✅ Configures CORS
6. ✅ Adds Lambda permissions

**Time**: 2-3 minutes

**Individual scripts** (if you want control):
```bash
./scripts/setup-iam.sh              # Step 1: IAM
./scripts/setup-dynamodb.sh         # Step 2: DynamoDB
./scripts/deploy-createUser.sh      # Step 3: Lambda
./scripts/setup-api-gateway.sh      # Step 4: API Gateway
```

## Option 3: Terraform (Infrastructure as Code) 🏗️

**Best for**: Production, teams, complex infrastructure

### Pros
- ✅ **Declarative** - describe what you want, not how
- ✅ **State management** - knows what's deployed
- ✅ **Preview changes** - see before applying
- ✅ **Rollback** - easy to revert
- ✅ **Multi-cloud** - works with AWS, Azure, GCP
- ✅ **Modules** - reusable components
- ✅ **Industry standard** - used in production

### Cons
- ❌ Steepest learning curve
- ❌ Need to learn HCL syntax
- ❌ State file management
- ❌ Overkill for simple projects

### How to Use
Follow: **`terraform/README.md`**

**Prerequisites**:
```bash
# Install Terraform
brew install terraform  # macOS

# Configure AWS credentials
aws configure
```

**Quick Start**:
```bash
cd terraform

# Initialize
terraform init

# Preview changes
terraform plan

# Deploy
terraform apply
# Type 'yes' when prompted
```

**What it does**:
- Same as CLI scripts, but with state tracking
- Can preview changes before applying
- Easy to modify and redeploy

**Time**: 2-3 minutes (after learning Terraform)

## 🎯 Recommendation by Scenario

### Scenario 1: "I'm new to AWS and want to learn"
**→ Use AWS Console** (Option 1)
- Follow `DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md`
- Take your time, explore each service
- Understand what each component does

### Scenario 2: "I want to deploy quickly and move on"
**→ Use AWS CLI Scripts** (Option 2) ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
- Run `./scripts/deploy-all.sh`
- Done in 2-3 minutes
- Focus on coding, not infrastructure

### Scenario 3: "I want to learn industry-standard tools"
**→ Use Terraform** (Option 3)
- Great for resume/portfolio
- Learn Infrastructure as Code
- Valuable skill for DevOps/Cloud roles

### Scenario 4: "I'm working with a teammate"
**→ Use AWS CLI Scripts or Terraform** (Options 2 or 3)
- Reproducible setup
- Both teammates get identical infrastructure
- Version controlled in Git

### Scenario 5: "I already have some resources created"
**→ Use AWS CLI Scripts** (Option 2)
- Scripts check if resources exist
- Won't duplicate or break existing setup
- Safe to run multiple times

---

## 🔄 Can I Mix Options?

**Yes!** You can:
- Create DynamoDB with Console, Lambda with CLI
- Start with Console, switch to scripts later
- Use Terraform for some resources, Console for others

**But**: Stick to one method for consistency and easier troubleshooting.

---

## 📝 What About RDS?

**All options require manual RDS setup** because:
- VPC/security group complexity
- Free tier instance selection
- Database initialization
- Cost considerations (want to stop when not using)

**For RDS**, follow `DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md` sections B1-B3 regardless of which option you choose.

---

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

Regardless of which option you use, test with:

```bash
# Get your API endpoint
# Console: Copy from API Gateway console
# CLI: Shown at end of script
# Terraform: Run `terraform output api_endpoint`

API_ENDPOINT="https://your-api-id.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"

# Test user creation
curl -X POST "$API_ENDPOINT/users" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"fullName":"Test User","dob":"2000-01-01","email":"test@example.com","initialBalance":100}'

# Expected: {"userId":"...","balance":100}
```

---

## 💰 Cost Comparison

**All options cost the same** - they create identical AWS resources:
- DynamoDB: Free tier (on-demand)
- Lambda: Free tier (1M requests/month)
- API Gateway: Free tier (1M requests/month)
- **Total**: $0/month for this project

---

## 🆘 Which Should I Choose?

### If you're unsure, use **Option 2 (AWS CLI Scripts)** because:
1. ✅ Fast (2-3 minutes)
2. ✅ Easy to use (one command)
3. ✅ Reproducible (teammates can use)
4. ✅ No new tools to learn (just bash)
5. ✅ Good balance of speed and learning

### Start here:
```bash
./scripts/deploy-all.sh
```

## 🎓 For Your Resume

**Good**: "Deployed serverless application using AWS Console"
**Better**: "Automated AWS deployment with CLI scripts"
**Best**: "Implemented Infrastructure as Code with Terraform"

All are valuable! Choose based on your goals and timeline.

## 🚀 Quick Decision Tree

```
Do you have 30+ minutes and want to learn AWS visually?
├─ YES → Use AWS Console (DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md)
└─ NO  → Continue...

Do you want the fastest deployment?
├─ YES → Use CLI Scripts (./scripts/deploy-all.sh)
└─ NO  → Continue...

Do you want to learn Infrastructure as Code?
├─ YES → Use Terraform (cd terraform && terraform apply)
└─ NO  → Use CLI Scripts (default choice)
```

---

**My recommendation**: Start with **CLI Scripts** (Option 2). It's the sweet spot of speed, learning, and practicality. You can always explore Console or Terraform later!

**Ready to deploy?**
```bash
./scripts/deploy-all.sh
```
