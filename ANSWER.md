# Answer: Can You Automate AWS Configuration?

## Short Answer: **YES!** ✅

You have **3 options** to deploy AWS infrastructure:

---

## Option 1: AWS Console (Manual) 🖱️
**What**: Click through AWS web interface
**Time**: 30-60 minutes
**Guide**: `DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md`

```
❌ NOT automated - you have to do it manually
✅ Good for learning and understanding AWS
```

---

## Option 2: AWS CLI Scripts (Automated) 🚀 **RECOMMENDED**
**What**: Run bash scripts that call AWS CLI
**Time**: 2-3 minutes
**Guide**: `scripts/README.md`

```bash
# One command deploys everything!
./scripts/deploy-all.sh
```

**What it creates**:
- ✅ IAM role with all permissions
- ✅ DynamoDB table
- ✅ Lambda function (createUser)
- ✅ API Gateway with routes
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Lambda permissions

```
✅ FULLY AUTOMATED - no console needed!
✅ Reproducible - same result every time
✅ Fast - 2-3 minutes
✅ Version controlled in Git
```

---

## Option 3: Terraform (Infrastructure as Code) 🏗️
**What**: Declare infrastructure in code, Terraform creates it
**Time**: 2-3 minutes (after learning Terraform)
**Guide**: `terraform/README.md`

```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```

```
✅ FULLY AUTOMATED - no console needed!
✅ State management - tracks what's deployed
✅ Preview changes before applying
✅ Industry standard for production
```

## Which Should You Use?

### For This Project: **Option 2 (CLI Scripts)** ⭐

**Why?**
- ✅ Fastest to get started (no new tools to learn)
- ✅ Fully automated (no console clicking)
- ✅ Works with your existing setup
- ✅ Scripts are already written for you!

**How?**
```bash
# Make sure AWS CLI is configured
aws configure

# Run the master script
chmod +x scripts/deploy-all.sh
./scripts/deploy-all.sh

# Done! ✅
```

---

## What Still Needs Console?

**Only RDS setup** requires manual steps because:
- VPC/security group complexity
- Free tier instance selection
- You want to stop it when not testing (save money)

**But even RDS can be partially automated**:
```bash
# After creating RDS instance in console, automate the rest:
mysql -h <endpoint> -u admin -p < database/mysql-transactions.sql

aws secretsmanager create-secret \
  --name capitalone/rds/mysql \
  --secret-string '{"username":"admin","password":"...","host":"...","port":3306}'
```

---

## Complete Automation Flow

```bash
# Step 1: Automated (2-3 minutes)
./scripts/deploy-all.sh
# Creates: IAM, DynamoDB, Lambda, API Gateway

# Step 2: Manual (10 minutes) - RDS only
# - Create RDS instance in console
# - Run SQL schema
# - Create Secrets Manager secret

# Step 3: Automated (1 minute)
./scripts/deploy-transactionService.sh  # TODO: Create this script
# Deploys transaction Lambda with VPC config

# Done! 🎉
```

## Try It Now!

```bash
# Check if AWS CLI is configured
aws sts get-caller-identity

# If not configured:
aws configure
# Enter: Access Key, Secret Key, Region (us-east-1), Format (json)

# Deploy everything
./scripts/deploy-all.sh

# Test it works
API_ENDPOINT=$(aws apigatewayv2 get-apis --query "Items[?Name=='CapitalOne-Banking-API'].ApiEndpoint" --output text --region us-east-1)
curl -X POST "$API_ENDPOINT/users" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"fullName":"Test","dob":"2000-01-01","email":"t@e.com","initialBalance":100}'

# Expected: {"userId":"...","balance":100}
```
